# Mod Npc Promotion

[English](README.md) | [Espa√±ol](README_ES.md)

This module, aims to provide a promotion to players within the server. It is still under development, but the idea is to make it as configurable as possible, modifying values within the configuration files (.conf)

Make sure you run all the .sql's inside the folder. I recommend cloning the repository using git so you don't miss out on future updates.

Soon I will be making a video in Spanish, to explain how it works.
